Ok , now it's working like a normal component .

This is a maven component project ,
that means if you want to develope this component ,
you need to install maven enviroment .

If you are a eclipse guy , you need m2eclipse anyways .
I am not going to talk about maven too much , you can find a lot data in internet about it.


I put a simple testing zul (index.zul) in [src/test/resources] ,
and I hope this is enough to use now , because that's what i need.


I think about that may be we need a read-only version ,
think if we need a feature like that, if you find any user-case about it ,
maybe we should do one.



## Thanks Richard , who provide the ideas and the skeleton zul for me . :) ##

Anyway , if you want to contribute anything for this project,
it's welcome , just let me know . (tonylovejava@gmail.com)
